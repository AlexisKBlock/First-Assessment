        This website is about movies because I love movies but I hate most
        movies. It has my recommendations which is a small list. Lets be real
        here, nicholas cages career is dead and thats why all of his movies are
        in the five dollar bin at walmart. Dune did not deserve six oscars and
        Jessica Chastain did not deserve best actress (if your asking who that
        is. Exactly).

      <p>
        You may be wondering why this movie is here. I know I said Nicholas
        Cages career is dead, but then Antonio Banderas exists.
